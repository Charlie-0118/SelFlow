Code and other models will come soon. Please first check our [DDFlow](https://github.com/ppliuboy/DDFlow), which employs a simple but effective strategy to cope with occluded pixels.

Our SelFlow is the 1st place winner on [Sintel Optical Flow Benchmark](http://sintel.is.tue.mpg.de/results) since November 2018.
